## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings & Challenges

### What Went Well
- Spring Boot setup was straightforward with good documentation
- Next.js with TypeScript provided excellent developer experience
- Tailwind CSS enabled rapid UI development
- Bean Validation simplified server-side validation

### Challenges Faced
- **JWT Integration** (+2 hours): Initially struggled with JWT configuration
- **CORS Issues** (+1 hour): Spent time debugging cross-origin requests
- **Form Validation Logic** (+2 hours): Complex validation rules took longer than expected
- **Responsive Design** (+1 hour): Mobile optimization required additional iterations

### Time Variance Analysis
- **Over-estimation**: Documentation took longer due to comprehensive coverage
- **Under-estimation**: Validation logic was more complex than initially planned
- **Unexpected Issues**: CORS and JWT setup added unplanned hours

## ðŸš€ Optimization Opportunities

If I were to restart this project:
1. **Start with JWT early** - Would save integration time later
2. **Use form library** - React Hook Form could reduce custom validation time
3. **Component design first** - Design system approach would speed up UI development
4. **Database seeding** - Automated test data would improve testing efficiency

## ðŸ“ˆ Skills Developed

### Technical Skills
- Spring Boot application architecture
- JWT authentication implementation
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- MySQL database design
- API design and documentation

### Soft Skills
- Time estimation and project planning
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Documentation writing
- Self-directed learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These features were considered but not implemented due to time constraints:
- Email verification system (estimated +4 hours)
- Rate limiting for security (estimated +2 hours)
- Comprehensive unit testing (estimated +6 hours)
- Internationalization (estimated +5 hours)
- Advanced admin dashboard (estimated +8 hours)
